Project Goal

Debug and fix critical issues in the JobVerse automated recruitment website, focusing on messaging stability, application submission UI, and employer application status handling.

Task 0 – Bug Reproduction & Log Analysis

Reproduce all reported issues on both roles:

candidate

employer

Check:

Browser console errors

Network requests (request / response / status codes)

Backend logs

Identify whether issues come from:

API response structure

Frontend state handling

Missing or incorrect error handling

Task 1 – Fix Messaging Feature Errors (Candidate ↔ Company)
Current Issues

When sending a message:

A console error appears immediately

After sending a message and refreshing the page:

The messaging page breaks or throws an error

Conversation or messages fail to load

Expected Behavior

Sending a message should:

Not trigger console errors

Successfully update the message list

After page reload:

Conversation and message history should load correctly

No runtime or state errors should occur

Required Actions

Backend:

Verify message creation API response format

Ensure conversation ID and message list are returned correctly

Frontend:

Fix state update after sending a message

Ensure message fetching API is called on page reload

Add null / undefined checks for conversation and message data

Task 2 – Fix Job Application Submission UI Error (Candidate)
Current Issue

When applying for a job:

User fills in description / additional information

UI shows an error message

BUT backend has successfully received and stored the application

Expected Behavior

If backend successfully creates the application:

UI should show success feedback

No error message should be displayed

Required Actions

Backend:

Verify response status code (should be 200 / 201)

Ensure response body matches frontend expectations

Frontend:

Fix success vs error handling logic

Ensure UI relies on HTTP status or success flag correctly

Prevent false-negative error messages

Task 3 – Employer Application Status Update Limitation
Current Issue

When logged in as employer:

Can only change application status to:

Pending

Reviewing

Cancelled

Other statuses do not work or are rejected

Expected Behavior

Employer should be able to update application status to all valid statuses, such as:

Accepted

Rejected

Interview

Hired
(depending on defined business rules)

Required Actions

Backend:

Review application status enum / validation logic

Ensure all allowed statuses are:

Defined

Accepted by update API

Frontend:

Ensure status values sent match backend enum values exactly

Authorization:

Employer can only update applications for their own jobs

Task 4 – Frontend–Backend Contract Alignment
Goal

Ensure frontend and backend are fully synchronized.

Required Actions

Validate:

API request payloads

API response schemas

Status codes and error handling

Fix any mismatch causing:

UI errors despite backend success

Crashes after page reload

Task 5 – Final Stability & Regression Testing
Checklist

Messaging works without console errors

Messages persist after page reload

Job application submission shows correct UI feedback

Employer can update all valid application statuses

No new regressions introduced
