Repo: dphaitom/jobverse
Goal: Finish the JobVerse automated job marketplace website with complete user + employer flows.

Hard constraint:

Do NOT change or break any existing API endpoints.
You may only add new APIs/endpoints and add new frontend logic that consumes them.
Refactors are ok only if they don’t alter existing API contracts.
Task 0 — Project audit + plan (required first)
Inspect the repo structure and identify:
backend framework(s) (Java/Spring? Python? etc.) and frontend entry points (JS).
current auth flow (login/register endpoints, JWT/session, user model).
role handling (user vs employer) and where profile/company/job pages are implemented.
Output:
a short architecture summary
a prioritized implementation plan
a list of new APIs you intend to add (names/paths + request/response sketch)
Task 1 — Fix authentication to support real email login (baseline)
Problem: Currently cannot log in with real email accounts.
Implement:

Ensure email/password login works reliably end-to-end (frontend + backend).
Validate email format, handle error messages, and ensure tokens/sessions persist.
If there is no solid token/session mechanism, add a new endpoint(s) rather than changing existing ones.
Acceptance checks:

A user can register (if supported), then log in with email/password, refresh the page, and still remain logged in.
Clear error states for wrong password / unverified user (if relevant).
Task 2 — Add avatar upload/update (user profile)
Implement:

Add avatar upload/update for logged-in users:
backend: new endpoint(s) to upload image and update user profile avatar URL/path
storage: local/dev-friendly storage is acceptable; document how it works
frontend: add UI to pick image, upload, preview, and save.
Display avatar consistently (navbar/profile).
Acceptance checks:

User uploads an image and sees it immediately.
Avatar persists after refresh.
File type/size validation.
Task 3 — Fix “My Profile” stats + lists (Applied jobs & Saved jobs)
Problem: “Applied jobs” and “Saved jobs” display incorrectly.
Implement:

Make “My Profile” correctly show:
list of applied jobs
list of saved jobs
counts for each
years of experience display (use existing data if present; if missing, add via new field + new endpoint, do not alter old endpoints)
Ensure correct loading/empty/error states.
Acceptance checks:

Lists match server data.
Counts are correct and update after applying/saving a job.
Task 4 — Add missing navigation: sidebar on Saved Jobs page
Implement:

Add a sidebar navigation on the Saved Jobs page to go back to other areas.
Prefer reusing an existing layout/sidebar component if one already exists.
Acceptance checks:

Sidebar is visible and links work.
UI consistent with the rest of the app.
Task 5 — Employer role MVP: job posting + basic management
Problem: Employer role is missing job posting and core functionality.
Implement an employer MVP flow:

Employer can:
create a job post
view list of their job posts
edit/close/delete job posts (choose minimal set if time-limited)
Add backend models + new APIs for employer job management.
Add frontend pages/forms for employer dashboard.
Acceptance checks:

Employer can create a job and see it listed.
Validation errors are handled (missing title/description/etc.).
Task 6 — Connect user ↔ employer flow for testing (apply + view applicants)
Implement:

User can apply to a job (if not already working, implement minimally with a new apply endpoint).
Employer can view applicants per job (basic list: user name/email, application date, status).
Prevent duplicate applications if appropriate.
Acceptance checks:

User applies → employer sees applicant in dashboard.
Basic permission checks: only employer owner can view applicants.
Task 7 — Fix Company page to display jobs
Problem: Company page does not show jobs.
Implement:

Add/fix API to fetch jobs by company/employer.
Render those jobs on the company page with pagination or simple list.
Acceptance checks:

Company page shows correct jobs for that company.
Handles no jobs gracefully.
Final deliverables (required)
No existing APIs changed; only new endpoints added.
Update README with any new env vars (OAuth secrets, upload path, etc.).
Provide manual test steps for each task.
Start now:
Run Task 0 first, then implement tasks in order. For each task, show:

files changed
new APIs added (paths + payload)
how to test manually
