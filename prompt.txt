Project Goal

Improve the visual quality and user experience of the JobVerse website, focusing on Light Theme animation, motion consistency, and Featured Companies UI alignment, without changing any backend APIs.

Task 0 – Scope & Constraints

Review the current frontend UI and animations.

Strict constraints:

❗ Do NOT modify or add any backend APIs

❗ Do NOT change data contracts

Allowed changes:

✅ UI styles (CSS / Tailwind / theme config)

✅ Animations (Framer Motion or existing motion system)

✅ Component layout refinements (visual only)

Task 1 – Light Theme with Dark Theme Motion Effects
Current Situation

Light theme works functionally

Dark theme has better background motion / animation

Light theme feels static and visually less appealing

Expected Behavior

In Light Theme:

Keep background color white

BUT reuse / adapt background motion effects from Dark Theme

Subtle gradients

Animated blobs / waves / particles

Smooth motion transitions

Animations should be:

Lightweight

Non-distracting

Performance-friendly

UI Requirements

Background remains readable (no low contrast)

Motion opacity should be reduced compared to dark theme

Motion should feel consistent across pages

Task 2 – Motion Consistency Across Themes
Goal

Ensure motion language is consistent between:

Dark Theme

Light Theme

Required Actions

Reuse the same animation variants:

Fade

Slide

Scale

Background motion

Adjust:

Colors

Opacity

Blend modes

Avoid duplicating animation logic

Task 3 – Improve “Featured Companies” UI (Match Backend Data)
Current Issue

“Featured Companies” section UI does not fully match backend data

Visual structure feels disconnected from real data meaning

Expected Behavior

UI should clearly reflect backend-provided fields, such as:

Company logo

Company name

Industry / category

Number of jobs (if provided)

Location (if provided)

Layout should feel:

Clean

Professional

Consistent with the rest of the site

UI Enhancements

Use cards with:

Soft shadows

Rounded corners

Hover animations

Ensure spacing and typography hierarchy is clear

Improve visual balance between logo and text

Task 4 – Micro-interactions & Polish
Enhancements

Add subtle hover effects to:

Company cards

Buttons

Links

Improve transitions:

Page enter / exit

Card hover

Theme switching

Ensure animations feel:

Smooth

Responsive

Not excessive

Task 5 – Final UI Review & Consistency Check

Motion effects are consistent across themes

Featured Companies UI accurately reflects backend data

No API changes introduced

UI remains performant and accessible
