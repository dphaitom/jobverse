Project Goal:
Complete and finalize the JobVerse automated recruitment & e-commerce website.

Task 0 – System Review & Constraints

Review the current JobVerse system:

Frontend behavior

Existing backend APIs

User, company, messaging, notification, and profile modules

Critical constraint:

❗ Only API-level changes are allowed

❗ Do NOT modify frontend UI components, layouts, or styles directly

Any UI change must be enabled indirectly via APIs (data, configuration, or flags).

Task 1 – Company Messaging API (Candidate ↔ Company)
Current Issue

There is no visible way for a candidate to message a company.

Candidates cannot contact companies they have applied to.

Expected Behavior

A candidate should be able to send messages to a company they have already applied to.

Requirements

Add APIs to support:

Creating a conversation between candidate and company

Sending messages

Fetching message history

Messaging rules:

Only candidates who have applied to a company’s job can message that company

Companies can reply to candidates

API should return conversation metadata so frontend can render a “Message” button.

Task 2 – Fix Avatar Display API
Current Issue

Avatar upload/update works

But the avatar image cannot be displayed (broken or missing URL)

Expected Behavior

Users can see their current avatar correctly after uploading or updating it.

Requirements

Verify avatar storage and public access (URL generation).

Ensure profile APIs return:

Correct avatar URL

Accessible image path

Fix any mismatch between:

Stored avatar path

Returned API response

Ensure backward compatibility with existing frontend avatar rendering logic.

Task 3 – Light Mode Theme Configuration (API-driven)
Current Issue

In light mode, UI appearance is not as desired.

Expected Behavior (Light Mode)

Background color: white

Sidebar, header, footer:

Gray background

Black text

Constraints Handling

Since UI cannot be changed directly:

Implement this via API-based theme configuration

Example: /api/settings/theme or /api/ui-config

Requirements

Add an API that:

Returns theme configuration for light mode

Includes colors for background, sidebar, header, footer, text

Frontend will consume this configuration without changing UI code.

Task 4 – Notification System API
Current Issue

Clicking the notification button shows nothing

Notifications are not displayed.

Expected Behavior

Notifications should be shown when clicking the notification button.

Requirements

Implement or fix notification-related APIs:

Fetch notifications for the logged-in user

Mark notifications as read

Notification sources may include:

New job application updates

Company replies/messages

System events

API should return:

Notification list

Unread count (for badge display)

Task 5 – Final Validation & Integration Testing
Requirements

Verify all new APIs work correctly with the existing frontend:

Messaging

Avatar display

Theme configuration

Notifications

Ensure:

No breaking changes

Role-based access control is enforced

Provide sample API responses for frontend consumption.
